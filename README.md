## :grey_question: What is it?
* Analyzes Japanese subtitle files. Parses the most frequent words from the series via looking at each episode's subtitles.
## :zap: FEATURES:
* Creates subtitle objects!
* Parses the Japanese in each sub!
* Appends each parsing to a master Hashmap!
* Sorts by frequency!
* Creates a CSV of all of these words from each sub file, sorted by frequency!

###### :hammer: TO DO:
I will likely create a similar version of this for webscraping. Maybe later on I will make a GUI for it too. Good way to learn Java!
