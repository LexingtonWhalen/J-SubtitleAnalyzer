## FEATURES:
* Creates subtitle objects!
* Parses the Japanese in each sub!
* Appends each parsing to a master Hashmap!
* Sorts by frequency!
* Creates a CSV of all of these words from each sub file, sorted by frequency!

###### TO DO:
I will likely create a similar version of this for webscraping. Maybe later on I will make a GUI for it too. Good way to learn Java!
